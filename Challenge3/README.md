Problem statement:
We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value.

Tested the code with the below input:       
object = {"a":{"b":{"c":"d"}}}     
key = a/b/c     
output = d

object = {"x":{"y":{"z":"a"}}}       
key = x/y/z     
output = a
